Whoopsie!
Damn!
Umph!
Oof!
Well, that just sucks.
Aah! So good!
Oh, great!
My shift just got better!
Oh. Well, fuck.
God fucking DAMN it.
I fucking hate this place.
Somebody just fucking kill me already
What.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Fucking hell are you serious?
A-bit fruity
I Just can't support that type of mindset.
Do I really want to see this?
Right now? Fuck.
It's just too fucking much for me to handle.
Nice.
You gotta be fucking kidding.
Oh
What?
This is the reason why I don't want to live anymore.
My day is ruined.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck!
FUCK!!!
FUCK!!!
AGAIN?
AGAIN?!
NO- FUCK. GODDAMNIT!
Yippie!
Maybe, just maybe.
Perhaps, but not quite.
Almost there!
Oh, so close!
I'm a fucking lawyer.
I ain't getting out of the hood with this one.
My disappointment is immeasurable.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING!
My life is like a video game. Dark Souls.
